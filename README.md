Project Title:
“Simulation and cryptanalysis of A5/1 stream cipher”

Objective:
A5/1 is a stream cipher used in GSM encryption. The objective of this project is to
understand the algorithm of A5/1 thoroughly and implement the stream cipher to simulate its
working in order to better gain the knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses. Also it is known that
this cipher has been broken and can be decrypted using various known attacks.
Hence, another objective of the project is to study some of the attacks that are proposed to
break A5/1 stream cipher and determine how useful they practically are and how much time they
actually take in order to break the cipher.

Motivation:
As mentioned earlier, A5/1 is still used in GSM encryption in many countries all over the
world. Hence, nearly most of the phone calls’ secrecy worldwide depends upon the security of A5/1
stream cipher. If this cipher can be broken in real time then this is a serious problem concerning the
privacy of phone calls. Therefore, in order to better understand this scenario we try to understand
the actual working of this stream cipher by implementing it. After that we analyze the proposed
attacks on this stream cipher and evaluate their practical importance as to wether they actually are
able to break the encryption in real time or not.

Deliverables:
1)Implementation of A5/1 stream cipher which allows key initialization, encryption and
decryption. Probability[Enc(Dec(m,k),k) = m] = 1.
